description: "Create animated explainer videos with Remotion from a prompt, a script, subtitles (.srt) or a YouTube video: stick-figure characters with snappy cartoon action, titles that slam and fall, impact effects, original synthesized sound effects and music, chapter cards, optional burned-in captions, and voiceover sync that re-times the whole animation to a recorded narration. Finds an existing Remotion install or sets one up in the folder the user chooses. Use this skill whenever the user wants to make an animated video, explainer, motion-graphics or \"cartoon\" video from text, a topic, a transcript, subtitles or another video, mentions Remotion, stick figures / stickman / omini, cartoon action / fight-style animation, wants a video for a voiceover they will record, or needs to sync an animation to a recorded voice, even if they don't say \"skill\" or \"Remotion\"."

# Stickman Video

Turns content (prompt, script, subtitles, YouTube video) into a stick-figure animated explainer
rendered with Remotion, with original sound effects and music, and keeps it in sync with a
voiceover recorded later.

The bundled engine (`assets/engine/`, copied into the project as `src/stickman/`) provides
posable characters, physical text, impacts, camera shake and props, so the work is choreography,
not plumbing. Paths below are relative to this skill's folder; run scripts with Python 3.

## 0. Settle the brief (ask only what you can't infer)

Use the user's language for everything they read or hear (scripts, on-screen text, questions).

- **Content source**: prompt/topic · script/text · .srt · YouTube URL / long transcript.
- **Voiceover**: *none* · *recorded later* · *already recorded* (audio file).
  This decides how timing works (see step 2), so ask if it is unclear.
- **Format**: 16:9 1920×1080 (default) or 9:16 1080×1920 (vertical: lay scenes out for that frame).
- **Length**: for a prompt or a long source, agree a target (an explainer is usually 1–4 min).
- **Burned-in captions**: optional.

## 1. Find or install Remotion

```bash
python scripts/find_remotion.py            # add --path DIR if the user named a folder
```

It prints Node/npm versions and every Remotion project it finds (current folder and parents,
sub-folders, home, drive roots).

- One project found → use it (say which). Several → ask which one.
- None found, or the user wants a fresh one → ask: *"Install Remotion in `<current folder>`, or
  is it installed somewhere else (path)?"* A new install downloads a few hundred MB, so confirm.
- No Node.js → tell the user to install Node LTS from nodejs.org first.

Then prepare the project (installs the engine's packages pinned to the project's Remotion
version, copies the engine and the contact-sheet helper):

```bash
python scripts/setup_project.py --dir <project>            # existing project
python scripts/setup_project.py --dir <folder> --create    # new project here
```

Exit code 2 = no project and no `--create`; exit code 3 = a non-Remotion `package.json` is there
(don't add Remotion to someone's app without asking). Then create the video folder:

```bash
python scripts/new_video.py --project <project> --slug <video-slug> [--size 1080x1920]
```

It copies `assets/template/` to `src/<slug>/`, creates `public/<slug>/` and registers the
composition (PascalCase of the slug) in `src/Root.tsx`.

## 2. Content → planned timeline

Everything in the video is anchored to a **timeline of narration cues** (`src/<slug>/timeline.ts`).

| Input | What to do |
|---|---|
| Prompt / topic | Write the script yourself (research facts if needed, keep claims accurate). |
| Long source (YouTube, transcript, long .srt) | `scripts/fetch_transcript.py <url> --out src.srt`, read it, condense it into a script of the target length. Credit the source in the end titles. |
| Script / text | Use it (tighten lines over ~16 words). |
| .srt that IS the narration plan | Use it as is: `--srt`. |

Script format: one paragraph per idea, `# Chapter title` lines for chapter cards.

```bash
python scripts/parse_input.py --script script.md --out <project>/src/<slug> --wps 2.6
python scripts/parse_input.py --srt narration.srt --out <project>/src/<slug>
```

This writes `timeline.ts`, `timeline.json` and `voiceover.srt` (the timed script to record from)
and reports duration and lines that are too fast (> 3.3 words/s): shorten those lines.

**Timing modes.** The narration drives timing only when there is a voiceover:
- *Voiceover (later or already recorded)*: `--wps 2.4–2.7`, a natural reading pace. The video's
  length is the timeline's length. A recorded voice never matches the plan exactly, which is why
  step 8 re-times everything to the real audio.
- *No voiceover*: the cues are just the pacing plan for on-screen text and beats; use `--wps 2.8–3.2`
  and feel free to move scene starts and set `DURATION` to the end of the last scene.

A voiceover that already exists: build the plan from the script/SRT the user read, then run
step 8 right away; or, if there is no script, `scripts/transcribe_voice.py voice.wav --out voice.srt`
and use that SRT with `--srt`.

## 3. Storyboard

Write `src/<slug>/storyboard.md`: one row per scene with the cue range, the visual metaphor, the
characters (colour + label), the on-screen text, the key beats (as `cue i + fraction`) and the SFX.
Read `references/animation-style.md` first: principles, a table of visual metaphors for abstract
ideas, and proven scene recipes (cold open, clauses, loop wheel, station pan, data beat, lessons,
ending). Scenes typically last 6–20 s; chapters get a `chapter()` card.

For videos longer than ~2 minutes, show the user a short scene list and let them adjust before
building; for short ones, just go.

## 4. Build the scenes

Read `references/engine-api.md` (the whole engine on one page) and look at
`src/<slug>/S01Example.tsx`. For each scene write `src/<slug>/Sxx<Name>.tsx`:

- A scene is a `React.FC<SceneProps>` (`{ from, dur }`) returning a `<Stage svg={…} html={…} hits={…} />`.
- **Anchor to cues, not seconds**: in `Video.tsx` use `from: cueStart(i)` for scene starts; inside
  scenes use `beat(from, i, frac)` for anything that must match words (a title appearing when it's
  said, a hit on a key word). Short reactions can use fixed offsets from those anchors.
- Export the scene's SFX list (`SxxSFX: SfxCue[]`) with cues on the same frames as the action and
  add `{ c, from, sfx }` to `SCENES`. Replace the example scene when the first real scene exists.

## 5. Check visually (before any full render)

```bash
cd <project> && npx tsc --noEmit
node stickman-sheet.mjs <Composition> out/sheet-s02.png 0-450:45     # frames or ranges a-b:step
```

Open the contact sheet image and look for: text over characters, labels covered by held props,
props off-frame, characters floating or sinking (use `groundY(scale)`), unreadable text, scenes
where nothing moves for > 2 s. Fix and re-check; it is far cheaper than re-rendering.
`references/pitfalls.md` lists the usual suspects.

## 6. Audio: effects and music

```bash
python scripts/gen_audio.py --out <project>/public/<slug> --plan "intro:8.7,card:2.2,play:52.6,card:2.2,tense:35,finale:12"
```

Everything is synthesized (no samples, no licensing). Make the plan from the timeline: one style
per chapter (`intro play tense mystery hope finale`, `card` for chapter cards), seconds = the
section's frames / fps, summing to the video length. Effect names are listed in `src/<slug>/sfx.ts`.

## 7. Render and verify

```bash
cd <project> && npx remotion render <Composition> out/<slug>.mp4
python scripts/check_render.py <project>/out/<slug>.mp4 --timeline <project>/src/<slug>/timeline.json --hits 5.9,61.5
```

A full render takes minutes: run it in the background. The check reports duration vs timeline,
audio peak/clipping and whether the listed big hits stand out.

Volumes, voice and captions are composition props (`music` 0.35, `sfx` 0.8, `voice`, `captions`),
editable in Remotion Studio (`npm run dev`) or with `--props='{"captions":true}'` on render.

## 8. Sync to the recorded voiceover

When the user has recorded the narration (from `voiceover.srt`), copy the file to
`<project>/public/<slug>/voice.wav` (or .mp3) and run:

```bash
python scripts/align_voice.py --timeline <project>/src/<slug>/timeline.json --audio <project>/public/<slug>/voice.wav --out <project>/src/<slug> --lang it
```

It transcribes the recording with word timestamps (needs `pip install faster-whisper`),
aligns it to the planned lines and rewrites the timeline with the real times (the plan is kept as
`timeline.planned.json`). Because scenes and beats are anchored to cues, they now follow the
reader's pace. Then render with `--props='{"voice":"voice.wav"}'`: the music ducks under the voice.

Read the report: `coverage` < 0.8 means the reading differs a lot from the script (check
`voice.aligned.srt`); `short_chapter_gaps` lists chapter cards without a pause in the voice.
`--srt transcript.srt` works without a transcriber but is less precise near pauses.

## Deliverables

Tell the user where everything is: the video (`out/<slug>.mp4`), `voiceover.srt` (lines and timing
to record), `storyboard.md`, and how to re-render after recording (step 8). Report the real
duration and anything you could not verify (you can't hear the audio: say so).

## Guardrails

- Real people appear only as labelled generic figures; violence stays cartoonish and off-body.
- Content summarised from someone else's video or text is credited in the end titles.
- Keep the audio original (gen_audio.py); if the user brings music, they own the rights.
- Don't add Remotion to an existing non-Remotion project, or install packages, without the
  user's OK.
